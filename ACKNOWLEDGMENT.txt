This project would never have been possible without the help of some people, so a shootout seems appropriate.

First of all, a huge thanks to Johan Pattyn for producing the prototypes of this project. 
Also Cedric Busschots and Hans Ingelberts deserve credit for the help with troubleshooting.
And of course, a special thanks to David L. Jones for releasing his schematics under an open source license and sharing all his knowledge.
