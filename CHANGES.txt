I changed and added several features.
* Replaced discrete DAC for voltage setting with PWM and lowpass filter DAC.
* Added capability of going down to 0V output voltage, by adding a negative supply (charge pump).
* Fixed the input buffer by using a rail-to-rail opamp.
* Changed charging circuitry to use hand solderable components.
* Changed boost converter for the same reason.
* Added on board FTDI chip for communication via micro USB port.
* Removed ethernet module.
* Changed screen to more generic type in stead of I2C type.
* Changed digital voltage to 5V instead of 3.3V
* Last but not least: tested the schematic and verified the working.
