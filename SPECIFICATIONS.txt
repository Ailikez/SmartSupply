SmartSupply is a digital battery powered lab powersupply. It is Arduino compatible and can be controlled via PC over USB.

Specifications:
 * 0 - 1A,  steps of 1 mA  (10 bit DAC)
 * 0 - 20V, steps of 20 mV (10 bit DAC) (true 0V operation)
 * Current measurement: < 40mA:  10uA resolution (ina219)
 					    < 80mA:  20uA resolution (ina219)
 					    < 160mA: 40uA resolution (ina219)
					    < 320mA: 80uA resolution (ina219)
					    > 320mA: 1mA  resolution (10 bit ADC)
 * Voltage measurement: 20 mV resolution (10 bit ADC)
 
Features: 
 * Constant voltage and constant current modes
 * Uses a low noise linear regulator, preceded by a tracking preregulator to minimize power dissipation
 * Aluminium case end panel used as heatsink 
 * Use of handsolderable components to keep the project accessible 
 * Programmed with Arduino IDE
 * PC communication via Java over micro usb
 * Powered by 2 protected 18650 Lithium Ion cells


The schematic is a derivative of EEVBLOG's uSupply (see LICENSE.txt).
These are the most noticable changes from his schematic: 
 * Replaced discrete DAC for voltage setting with PWM and lowpass filter DAC (10 bit).
 * Added capability of going down to 0V output voltage, by adding a negative supply (charge pump).
 * Fixed the input buffer by using a rail-to-rail opamp.
 * Changed charging circuitry to use hand solderable components.
 * Changed boost converter for the same reason.
 * Added on board FTDI chip for communication via micro USB port.
 * I left the FTDI breakout header so you can avoid the FTDI chip (difficult footprint) and use an off the shelf solution
 * Removed ethernet module.
 * Changed screen to more generic type in stead of I2C type.
 * Changed digital voltage to 5V instead of 3.3V
 * Last but not least: tested the schematic and verified the working.
